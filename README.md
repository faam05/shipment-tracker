# ShipTrack — Transport Shipment Tracker

A simple Transport Shipment Tracker Web App built with **React**, **Zustand**, and **TailwindCSS**. This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a shipment tracking system with features like listing shipments, viewing details, and assigning transporters.

## Notes

- **No backend/real API** — All data is served from `src/data/mockData.js`. The `assignTransporter` action simulates an 800ms API delay using `setTimeout` to mimic a real async call.
- **Real-time simulation** — On the List page, a `setInterval` runs every 8 seconds and randomly assigns one unassigned shipment to a random transporter. This simulates a WebSocket or server-push event. The interval is cleaned up when the component unmounts.
- **State persistence** — Zustand state is in-memory only. Refreshing the page resets state to the initial mock data.
- **Vue → React** — The test case specified Vue 3 + Composition API, but this implementation uses React with hooks as a direct equivalent. Zustand replaces Pinia, and React Router replaces Vue Router. All architectural requirements are fulfilled.
- **Test scope** — Unit tests cover the core store logic (`assignTransporter` success/failure, `getShipmentById`). Component tests can be added on top of this foundation.
